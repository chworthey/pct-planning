## DEADLINE: August 15. Deadline is here to avoid heavy snowfall in the Sierras (within my risk tolerance) that starts anywhere from late september to early November.

I'm still not sure what my pace will be, but if it turns out to be highly athletic that might open up a 3rd option which is to beat the deadline (I'm not going to push it though).
